# Threaded-Port-Scanner
The TCP Threader Scanner is a Python script that allows users to scan a range of TCP ports on a given IP address or hostname. The script utilizes multithreading to improve the scan speed and supports a wide range of port numbers. The script prints the open TCP ports in the given range and shows the time taken for the scan to complete.
