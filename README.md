# Threaded-Port-Scanner

This script is a multi-threaded TCP and UDP port scanner that allows the user to scan a range of ports for a given IP address or hostname. The script prompts the user to enter the IP address or hostname to scan, as well as the range of ports to scan. It then creates multiple threads to scan different ranges of ports concurrently, making the scanning process faster.

# Requirements:

* Python 3.x
* socket module
* sys module
* datetime module
* threading module

# Usage:

1. Run the script using python TCP_UDP_Threader_Scanner.py command.

2. Enter the IP address or hostname to scan

3. Enter the start and end port range to scan.

4. The script will start scanning and print the open TCP and UDP ports.

5. Once the scanning is finished, the script will print a message indicating that the scan is complete.
